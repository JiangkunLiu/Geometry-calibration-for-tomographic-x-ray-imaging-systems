# Geometry-calibration-for-tomographic-x-ray-imaging-systems
An Matlab implementation for geometry calibration of an x-ray imaging system. 

The methods and algorithm are inspired by Li, Xinhua, Da Zhang, and Bob Liu. ["A generic geometric calibration method for tomographic imaging systems with flat-panel detectorsâ€”A detailed implementation guide."](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapm/journal/medphys/37/7/10.1118/1.3431996) Medical physics 37, 7 (2010): 3844-3854.

## How to install?
Drag the function file (`solveGeo.m`) into your project and/or add it to your matlab function search path. 

## How to use?
### General usage
The function will output three values corresponding to the x-ray focal spot positions (in pixels) x, y, and z in the detector coordinate system. 

1. Load the 3D coordinates of the features of the calibration phantom in Matlab. We recommend format this file into a `m-by-3` matrix, where `m` is the total number of features in the phantom. The first column is the `x` coordinates of the features in the **phantom coordination system**. The second and third column corresponds the `y` and `z` coordinates. 

  **IMPORTANT: Your phantom MUST have at least 6 features.**

2. In the x-ray projection image of the phantom, use your own method to identify `m` features in the image. Find the coordinates of each feaute in the **projection image coordinate system**. And make a `m-by-2` matrix `2D`, where the first column is the `x` coordinate of the feature in the image plane (`u`), and the second column is the `y` coordinates of the features in the image plane (`v`).
